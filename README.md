**About Me**

I’m a Data Analyst with a background in Sports Science and a strong interest in business and healthcare analytics.

My scientific training taught me how to measure performance, interpret data critically, and base decisions on structured analysis. Today, I apply that same analytical mindset to business and healthcare datasets, transforming raw information into clear insights.

My work combines SQL, Python, and Business Intelligence tools to analyze customer behavior, healthcare cost structures, financial time series and sales performance.
