**Introduction**

Hi data world, I'm Sebastian!

I'm a junior data analyst with a background in applied science and a genuine passion for analytical thinking and solving problems with data.

After working in sports science, I moved to another country and discovered the world of sales, which quickly caught my attention. It reminded me of what I had studied back in school: economics. That connection led me to become more interested in business, and eventually, that interest brought me into the world of data, where I finally found my place in the world.

I’ve learned the power of data to create change, more than I could ever do one on one, as it can drive both business and life decisions, shaping entire industries.

Over the last two years, I’ve completed a Career in Data Analytics and a Data Analytics Master’s program, and have been actively building personal projects to deepen my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and more.

This is the moment to showcase all the experience I’ve gained, including collaborating on dashboards at my current job for monthly sales analysis.
